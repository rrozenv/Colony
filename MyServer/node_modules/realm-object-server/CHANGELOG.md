# Release 2.0.22

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The health service no longer responds with 200 OK unless the server has fully
  started. It is 503 in case the server is still loading.
* The admin token user can now apply permission changes successfully.
* The early log messages do not get skipped in Studio any more.
* Users now have read-write access to their `/~/__permission` realms (again).
  The recent switch to read-only was an unintended breaking change.
* Fixed a potential race in the permission service. It reported itself started
  before setting up all the listeners and granting default permissions.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug where deleted-then-recreated objects with identical
  primary keys become empty.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug in outward partial sync to ensure
  convergence of partial sync in the case where the client creates a primary key object, that is already present on the server, and subscribes to it in the same transaction.
* Added error handling to the internal requests to the load balancer. This
  should fix some unhandled promise rejections.

### Enhancements
* TypeScript and JavaScript templates now have .gitignore

### Internals
* The logger will now accumulate early log messages until a listener
  (i.e. the LogService) is attached. Or it will explicitly say that they had
  to be skipped, in case the listener didn't attach for a very long time.
* ROS will grant read-write permissions on `/~/__permission` to all users upon
  startup.
* Updated realm-js to 2.0.11 ans Sync to 2.1.7
# Release 2.0.21

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Close all Permission Realm files used to avoid running out of file handles.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.20

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Welcome static files are now served with `ros init`

### Enhancements
* Spinner is included during dependencies installation of `ros init`

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.18

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Realms with invalid paths are now rejected. Previously ROS would just create
  unsyncable realms.
* Realms with invalid paths are now skipped during 1-to-2 migration. This is
  required because ROS-1 has the same behavior creating unsyncable realms, which
  we are not going to fix.
* Non-existent data files are not copied during 1-to-2 migration.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443
* HTTPS key and cert are now validated before attempting to start
* server.shutdown() is now more forgiving in failed state scenarios

### Enhancements
* Server now has a simple method called `openRealm` that takes a remote path, like `/__admin` for example. This is always opened up with the internal server admin user. The schema is optional. 

### Internals
* Release process now removes the internal release notes from public releases.  If it works, this line
  will not show up on https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

# Release 2.0.17

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The migration tool now also migrates global realms.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443

### Enhancements
* There are two new special realms where permissions are reflected.
  `/<userid>/__perm` contains user-specific permissions and `/__perm` contains
  wildcard permissions. The old special realms are still available and reflect
  the same permissions, but they might contain duplicates. They are only there
  for compatibility and will be removed in the future.
* `ros migrate` will copy realm files by default. Specify `--norealms` to disable that.
* Added notice to users about the long time 'ros init' can take.
* Updated realm-js to version 2.0.5

### Internals
* The user-specific permissions are now also reflected into `/<userid>/__perm`.
  The difference from `/<userid>/__permission` is that `__perm` has a primary
  key, which allows the merge algorithm to eliminate duplicates. The same
  changes were made to wildcard permission realm: the new version with primary
  key is `/__perm`. The old paths are still accessible and will contain
  duplicates as before. This was also a chance to name those realms
  consistently, which we did. So, the mapping from old to new is:
    `/<userid>/__permission` -> `/<userid>/__perm`
    `/__wildcardpermissions` -> `/__perm`
* Assert in Realm deletion unit test.
* Expose maxDownloadSize as a parameter to the server.

# Release 2.0.16

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a problem in the install script where nvm is installed by homebrew.
* Added note to install script reminding the user to use the correct Node.js version.
* Fixed an issue with exporting all custom realm symbols
* Added support Visual Studio Code debugging and running when generating a server setup with `ros init`
* Opening a partially synced Realm before the master Realm was created now works correctly
* Terms of service is now persisted under the user's home directory. Fixes \#550

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Updated the TS and JS templates to be easier to modify.
* Terms of service now generates a distinctId as a UUID and uses that in all mixpanel events. Fixes \#600
* Adding Mixpanel Usage Stats with Incremental timer
* Adds simple stats collection interfaces, loosely matching that of prom-client, a Prometheus stats
  emitter. In developer edition, metrics are stored in-memory, allowing mixpanel to access them.
* Adds ROS usage by emitting to mixpanel data about the connections that go through the SyncProxyService
* Exposes mix panel interface by gating it behind setting a distinctId. This is typically loaded from
  the agreement file.
* Created a MixpanelService which handles emitting stats periodically to mixpanel.

## 2.0.7

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed several possible race conditions during server start and stop.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Introduces a timeout function which will race a regular promise. This is crucial for avoiding deadlocks in service requests.
* SyncProxyService now uses a shared cache of backend promises, creating less work when multiple connections for the same realm happen at the same time. Also avoids race conditions in this case.
* Introduced a RealmFactory class which can provide access to Realms on backend sync workers. This is now separated from the Server class.
* Introduced ServerState, which is used to prohibit request processing when a service is not completely ready. This avoids some race conditions, mostly during shutdown. Possible fix for #327.
* discovery.watchService will now fire an available event if the service is available when called. This simplifies a lot of situations where this is done by the caller.

### Enhancements
* None

## 2.0.0-rc.11

### Fixed Bugs

* Log level from command line is propagated to sync server.
* Public and private key from the command line are used by the server.


## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Enhancements

* Added register argument to server.getSyncedRealm. This ensures that the
  SyncedRealm is not persisted in the cache.

  serving requests


## 2.0.0.rc9

### Breaking changes

### Fixed bugs
* Fixed a situation where getting a userId could be null in updateOrCreateUserPermissionWithAdminPermission in PermissionsService

## 2.0.0.rc8

### Breaking changes

### Enhancements
* Also skip Email prompts if ROS_SKIP_PROMPTS environment var is set.

* Added the agreement to license email step for the BasicServer

### Fixed bugs
* SyncProxyService: Fixed an issue when using sharded sync workers
* Fixed the issue when a synced realm used internally would be undefined or
  invalidated because of sync worker unavailability.

### Internals

* Changed the SyncedRealm class to return a Promise<Realm>. Once it resolves,
  the Realm is there, with valid syncSession which does not get destroyed when
  the sync worker fails over. It utilizes the new override_server() API to
  make the session reconnect to the new sync worker.
* Fixed all the other parts of ROS which use SyncedRealm. Some functions become
  async because of that.
* Changed the way the server starts and stops. Now there is no barrier between
  starting services and registering them. This is required, because now some
  services, in order to start, wait for the Sync service to register.
* Update JS to RC22 and Sync to 2.0.2
* Updated the schema for `/__wildcardpermissions` to match the `/~/__permission` Realms, using `userId = *` for these `Permission` objects.

## 2.0.0-rc.6
